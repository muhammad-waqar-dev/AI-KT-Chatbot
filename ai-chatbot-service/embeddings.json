again.\n\nIan Koenig (Guest)   0:18\nOK.\nThank you for joining everyone.\nUm, just quick protocol.\nI\u0027m gonna go through this, you know, at the pace that I think makes sense, but these concepts may be obvious.\nThey may be brand new and not obvious, so since I don\u0027t know the audience, just interrupt me if I\u0027m not reaching you.\nWe have an hour, you know, if I zip through it, it should go in about 30 minutes.\nSo there\u0027s plenty of time for questions.\nAnything before I get started.\nOK, then I\u0027m going to begin. What we\u0027re talking about today is what we\u0027re calling the enterprise master data model.\n\nAggarwal, Suyash joined the

Meenal joined the meeting\nIan Koenig (Guest)   4:09\nAnother critical concept. Content masters all use the Enterprise Master data model.\nAgain, an ideal statement.\nEnterprise Master Data model is optimized to store the single version of the truth.\nIt is optimized to store every item of data we receive and never delete data and never overwrite data and it sacrifices performance in order to do this.\nAnd what that is saying is you would never ever ever use the enterprise master data model to create a database that a user you know an end user application would use.\nBecause by using the enterprise master data model, we sacrifice performance and but that also implies you know internal users like content curators and therefore the way that we create those curation screens has to take into account the performance issues that are associated with the way we stored the data.\nEvery time we store our content item, we create a primary identifier for

Masters then create events that say ohh look, I\u0027ve got some new data or some change data that would go through the data publishing asset.\nData publishing then puts data into the data hub and what we call a data lake, and that data is now available for applications to pull right.\nData science is really the way I look at data science is it\u0027s a lot of algorithms that take data out, create new data and push it back in.\nSo data science is not a master it\u0027s a set of enrichment algorithms that create new data.\nBusiness systems are things that you know that interact with the customer and and create the business.\nGenerally, accounting let General Ledger customers CRM, those tend to be business systems.\nInternal systems are what are how we all the systems that support us

at the most sophisticated level, right, you could store all four of those values, right?\nBecause you\u0027re getting the same value from four different sources and assign a component to that to those values.\nBased on algorithms that can change over time, so the way humans process data right is we determine the truth through the accumulation of evidence.\nSo we may start off saying, you know, I, you know everything I read from from this, from this website I think is true until you start finding stuff that\u0027s not true.\nAnd then you start to shake your, you know, your confidence in that source of data.\nAnd that\u0027s exactly the way that we\u0027ve modeled this.\nSo you can you can have a confidence associated with the source.\nYou can have a confidence associated with the value, but in the simplest case right values are either right or wrong and we\u0027re either 100% confident or 100% not confident.\nThat\u0027s the simplest case, but the model supports all the levels in between.

the simplest case, but the model supports all the levels in between.\n\nUh.\n\nGetsy, Paul   20:37\nSo Ian, in Paul Getsy from MMIT here.\nSo how do you differentiate between a correction and a change?\n\nIan Koenig (Guest)   20:46\nOK, so a that exactly so a correction.\nSo let\u0027s say we have, you know, we have our first value for a fact of just called it value one, right.\nAnd now we have value 2 comes in.\nWell, value one is no longer, so we set the valid to date on value one that says it\u0027s no longer valid.\nIf it was a correction, that means that the value one is wrong, so we set the confidence on value 1 to a negative number.\nIf it\u0027s an update then value one was correct, it\u0027s just correct from a point of time from you know, in a in a date range and so therefore we leave confidence as a positive number.\nDoes that make sense?\n\nGetsy, Paul   21:39\nOK, so if I accidentally changed the name of company A and I was supposed to change the name of Company B then that would be in company

Ian joined the meeting\n\nIan Koenig (Guest)   24:23\nMost logical description is an address right?\nWhere we think of an address as a unit, but actually an address is, you know, the street address, the 2nd street address, the city, the state, the country, the the postal code, the you know, et cetera. Right.\nSo by, but we do that all in the metadata, presumption is all the values for a fact have the exact same data type.\nDoes that make sense?\n\nGeoff Cunningham   24:52\nBut the IT it makes sense that you can record the type in the in the fact pinguis table, but the the the the data type of the value column in the item that fact values table is is just one thing for all rows right?\nSo, so.\n\nIan Koenig (Guest)   25:08\nCorrect.\n\nGeoff Cunningham   25:09\nBut you still have to represent different actual underlying data types, so that\u0027s why I said.\nI was wondering if

what we call the related to ID scheme in my example this would be PGUID, which is a type of identifier, a permanent globally unique identifier, but it\u0027s a type of identifier and the reason we do that is we allow.\nFor example, let\u0027s say I know it\u0027s companies PGUID and 123, but all I have is the name John Q Smith, right?\nI can say that John Q Smith, whose scheme is a name, was the CEO of this company from the state to that day, or I don\u0027t know the dates yet.\nAnd those are all have to be resolved and that allows what we call lazy resolution and others.\nWe can create the relationship with a A, A vague identifier and then we\u0027re solve that at a later time into a unique identifier.\nRight.\nSo I\u0027m I\u0027ll I\u0027ll talk about classified on identifiers in just

classifiers tend to be taxonomies, right ways of defining you know a grouping.\nSo there are drug taxonomies, for example, right there are industry taxonomies that are associated with organizations

we we externalize classifiers from the data item again, right?\nIf it\u0027s one to one if every data item has one and only one classifier from a scheme you know, you could put it as a fact in the data item, but doing it as an externalized classifier allows you to attach multiple and a great example of that would be patent classifications, right?\nWhen you, there\u0027s a scheme called the International Patent Classification Scheme.\nInternational patent, OK.\nYeah, which is a hierarchical structure of topics that patents can be associated with, and a single patent can have an arbitrary number of patent classifications.\nSo it\u0027s nice and convenient to store those externally from the patent data item and those are what we call classifiers.\nFor each one of these, there\u0027s metadata, so I talked a bit about the fact metadata right, which is associated with both data item facts and relationship fact values, gives you the type, the name of the fact,

this is a slight asymmetry in the model, right?\nBecause there\u0027s one data item, the fact values are related back to the data item, but because there are multiple relationship predicates in the in the in the master for each relationship predicate, we say these are the facts associated with this relationship and I I think I had the example of that for identifiers, it\u0027s just the scheme and the description scheme is what type of identifier is it?\nIs this so?\nFor example name title.\nThere were lots of identify third party identifier schemes like you know ticker symbol is an identifier.\nUmm, this net last one, which we call a PVS which means property value set is a controlled vocabulary.\nIt is.\nWhat\u0027s the name of the control vocabulary?\nPVS items is an array of

other words, if I merge 2 data items, either because you know I was wrong to create two in the first place or you know the data items physically merged like in the case of corporate merger, we would preserve 1 PGUID going forward and the other one we would create a relationship called the linkstone relationship where the other PGUID would points to the the new PGUID.\nAnd in that case, that\u0027s how we make sure we never they\u0027re never holds, right.\nAnd we never delete PGUID.\nIt\u0027s so there\u0027s always an entry in the data items when a PGUID was first minted, it always remains.\nI\u0027m gonna pause for a minute.\nWell, actually 15 seconds, but long enough for anyone.\nThat\u0027s a good question.\nIf you have them.\nOK, fact values.\nNow, as I said right, the fact is a property of a data item that does not specifically identify it.\nOf course, you know, I said.\nWell, you could store identifiers as facts, so take that with a grain of salt.\nEvery fact value

then, like I said before, what\u0027s our confidence in that value?\nIs it a work in progress?\nWhen was it valid from valid to all the common elements and you can have multiple values from an array

the first thing we look at is how we how we model the the fact metadata.\nSo every single column here becomes a row in the metadata and then in the next slide you\u0027ll see how that maps on to rows in the in the database.\nSo the first thing we create is what I call a fact PGUID.\nFact it\u0027s always begin urn, colon fact, then the name of the uh, the master\u0027s name space.\nSo in this case, it\u0027s the organization master.\nIt\u0027s namespaces O RG, so by concatenating your in fact org one, I\u0027ve now created AP GUID for that fact.\nThe first PGUID.\nThe first fact is org name.\nNow org name is an identifier, but I\u0027ve chosen in this case to store it as a fact because at the moment I don\u0027t have the requirement to externalize identifiers.\nThe second item, short name another identifier, but I\u0027ve chosen to store it as a fact.\nThe compound type is 0, saying it\u0027s simple type is as collected saying no that is not an as collected field I create.\nI edit that field I even created or edited.\nYes, I own

even if it\u0027s a human process and you were required to keep both, then you have to keep you treat them as separate facts.\nLet me you know a more obvious example, right.\nLet\u0027s say you know you store the name of the drug in English and French.\nRight.\nThat is truly two separate facts, but actually in that case it\u0027s two separate fact values for the same fact, but they have different languages.\nSo if if you\u0027re carrying multiple languages for the same screen fact, you actually store 2 fat values for the same fact, and they\u0027re both valid.\nAnd again, business logic, would you publish them both in business logic would say ohh I\u0027m, you know presenting to a French user aren\u0027t gonna present the French name I\u0027m presenting to an English user.\nI\u0027ll

again.\n\nIan Koenig (Guest)   0:18\nOK.\nThank you for joining everyone.\nUm, just quick protocol.\nI\u0027m gonna go through this, you know, at the pace that I think makes sense, but these concepts may be obvious.\nThey may be brand new and not obvious, so since I don\u0027t know the audience, just interrupt me if I\u0027m not reaching you.\nWe have an hour, you know, if I zip through it, it should go in about 30 minutes.\nSo there\u0027s plenty of time for questions.\nAnything before I get started.\nOK, then I\u0027m going to begin. What we\u0027re talking about today is what we\u0027re calling the enterprise master data model.\n\nAggarwal, Suyash joined the

Meenal joined the meeting\nIan Koenig (Guest)   4:09\nAnother critical concept. Content masters all use the Enterprise Master data model.\nAgain, an ideal statement.\nEnterprise Master Data model is optimized to store the single version of the truth.\nIt is optimized to store every item of data we receive and never delete data and never overwrite data and it sacrifices performance in order to do this.\nAnd what that is saying is you would never ever ever use the enterprise master data model to create a database that a user you know an end user application would use.\nBecause by using the enterprise master data model, we sacrifice performance and but that also implies you know internal users like content curators and therefore the way that we create those curation screens has to take into account the performance issues that are associated with the way we stored the data.\nEvery time we store our content item, we create a primary identifier for

Masters then create events that say ohh look, I\u0027ve got some new data or some change data that would go through the data publishing asset.\nData publishing then puts data into the data hub and what we call a data lake, and that data is now available for applications to pull right.\nData science is really the way I look at data science is it\u0027s a lot of algorithms that take data out, create new data and push it back in.\nSo data science is not a master it\u0027s a set of enrichment algorithms that create new data.\nBusiness systems are things that you know that interact with the customer and and create the business.\nGenerally, accounting let General Ledger customers CRM, those tend to be business systems.\nInternal systems are what are how we all the systems that support us

at the most sophisticated level, right, you could store all four of those values, right?\nBecause you\u0027re getting the same value from four different sources and assign a component to that to those values.\nBased on algorithms that can change over time, so the way humans process data right is we determine the truth through the accumulation of evidence.\nSo we may start off saying, you know, I, you know everything I read from from this, from this website I think is true until you start finding stuff that\u0027s not true.\nAnd then you start to shake your, you know, your confidence in that source of data.\nAnd that\u0027s exactly the way that we\u0027ve modeled this.\nSo you can you can have a confidence associated with the source.\nYou can have a confidence associated with the value, but in the simplest case right values are either right or wrong and we\u0027re either 100% confident or 100% not confident.\nThat\u0027s the simplest case, but the model supports all the levels in between.

the simplest case, but the model supports all the levels in between.\n\nUh.\n\nGetsy, Paul   20:37\nSo Ian, in Paul Getsy from MMIT here.\nSo how do you differentiate between a correction and a change?\n\nIan Koenig (Guest)   20:46\nOK, so a that exactly so a correction.\nSo let\u0027s say we have, you know, we have our first value for a fact of just called it value one, right.\nAnd now we have value 2 comes in.\nWell, value one is no longer, so we set the valid to date on value one that says it\u0027s no longer valid.\nIf it was a correction, that means that the value one is wrong, so we set the confidence on value 1 to a negative number.\nIf it\u0027s an update then value one was correct, it\u0027s just correct from a point of time from you know, in a in a date range and so therefore we leave confidence as a positive number.\nDoes that make sense?\n\nGetsy, Paul   21:39\nOK, so if I accidentally changed the name of company A and I was supposed to change the name of Company B then that would be in company

Ian joined the meeting\n\nIan Koenig (Guest)   24:23\nMost logical description is an address right?\nWhere we think of an address as a unit, but actually an address is, you know, the street address, the 2nd street address, the city, the state, the country, the the postal code, the you know, et cetera. Right.\nSo by, but we do that all in the metadata, presumption is all the values for a fact have the exact same data type.\nDoes that make sense?\n\nGeoff Cunningham   24:52\nBut the IT it makes sense that you can record the type in the in the fact pinguis table, but the the the the data type of the value column in the item that fact values table is is just one thing for all rows right?\nSo, so.\n\nIan Koenig (Guest)   25:08\nCorrect.\n\nGeoff Cunningham   25:09\nBut you still have to represent different actual underlying data types, so that\u0027s why I said.\nI was wondering if

what we call the related to ID scheme in my example this would be PGUID, which is a type of identifier, a permanent globally unique identifier, but it\u0027s a type of identifier and the reason we do that is we allow.\nFor example, let\u0027s say I know it\u0027s companies PGUID and 123, but all I have is the name John Q Smith, right?\nI can say that John Q Smith, whose scheme is a name, was the CEO of this company from the state to that day, or I don\u0027t know the dates yet.\nAnd those are all have to be resolved and that allows what we call lazy resolution and others.\nWe can create the relationship with a A, A vague identifier and then we\u0027re solve that at a later time into a unique identifier.\nRight.\nSo I\u0027m I\u0027ll I\u0027ll talk about classified on identifiers in just

classifiers tend to be taxonomies, right ways of defining you know a grouping.\nSo there are drug taxonomies, for example, right there are industry taxonomies that are associated with organizations

we we externalize classifiers from the data item again, right?\nIf it\u0027s one to one if every data item has one and only one classifier from a scheme you know, you could put it as a fact in the data item, but doing it as an externalized classifier allows you to attach multiple and a great example of that would be patent classifications, right?\nWhen you, there\u0027s a scheme called the International Patent Classification Scheme.\nInternational patent, OK.\nYeah, which is a hierarchical structure of topics that patents can be associated with, and a single patent can have an arbitrary number of patent classifications.\nSo it\u0027s nice and convenient to store those externally from the patent data item and those are what we call classifiers.\nFor each one of these, there\u0027s

this is a slight asymmetry in the model, right?\nBecause there\u0027s one data item, the fact values are related back to the data item, but because there are multiple relationship predicates in the in the in the master for each relationship predicate, we say these are the facts associated with this relationship and I I think I had the example of that for identifiers, it\u0027s just the scheme and the description scheme is what type of identifier is it?\nIs this so?\nFor example name title.\nThere were lots of identify third party identifier schemes like you know ticker symbol is an identifier.\nUmm, this net last one, which we call a PVS which means property value set is a controlled vocabulary.\nIt is.\nWhat\u0027s the name of the control vocabulary?\nPVS items is an array of

other words, if I merge 2 data items, either because you know I was wrong to create two in the first place or you know the data items physically merged like in the case of corporate merger, we would preserve 1 PGUID going forward and the other one we would create a relationship called the linkstone relationship where the other PGUID would points to the the new PGUID.\nAnd in that case, that\u0027s how we make sure we never they\u0027re never holds, right.\nAnd we never delete PGUID.\nIt\u0027s so there\u0027s always an entry in the data items when a PGUID was first minted, it always remains.\nI\u0027m gonna pause for a minute.\nWell, actually 15 seconds, but long enough for anyone.\nThat\u0027s a good question.\nIf you have them.\nOK, fact values.\nNow, as I said right, the fact is a property of a data item that does not specifically identify it.\nOf course, you know, I said.\nWell, you could store identifiers as facts, so take that with a grain of salt.\nEvery fact value

the first thing we look at is how we how we model the the fact metadata.\nSo every single column here becomes a row in the metadata and then in the next slide you\u0027ll see how that maps on to rows in the in the database.\nSo the first thing we create is what I call a fact PGUID.\nFact it\u0027s always begin urn, colon fact, then the name of the uh, the master\u0027s name space.\nSo in this case, it\u0027s the organization master.\nIt\u0027s namespaces O RG, so by concatenating your in fact org one, I\u0027ve now created AP GUID for that fact.\nThe first PGUID.\nThe first fact is org name.\nNow org name is an identifier, but I\u0027ve chosen in this case to store it as a fact because at the moment I don\u0027t have the requirement to externalize identifiers.\nThe second item, short name another identifier, but I\u0027ve chosen to store it as a fact.\nThe compound type is 0, saying it\u0027s simple type is as collected saying no that is not an as collected field I create.\nI edit that field I even created or edited.\nYes, I own

you store the name of the drug in English and French.\nRight.\nThat is truly two separate facts, but actually in that case it\u0027s two separate fact values for the same fact, but they have different languages.\nSo if if you\u0027re carrying multiple languages for the same screen fact, you actually store 2 fat values for the same fact, and they\u0027re both valid.\nAnd again, business logic, would you publish them both in business logic would say ohh I\u0027m, you know presenting to a French user aren\u0027t gonna present the French name I\u0027m presenting to an English user.\nI\u0027ll
